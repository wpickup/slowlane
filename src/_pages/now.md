## What Iâ€™m doing now

(This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a>, too.)

Updated May 18th, 2023.

Getting into being 60, some things are harder, others easier.

Grateful to have a couple of long term friends.

Nearly bought a campervan but in end just couldn't match the cost to the value.

Looking forward to taking more breaks and travelling with my wife.
